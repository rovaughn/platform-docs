Hasura project microservices
============================

A :doc:`Hasura project <../project/index>` is composed of a set of microservices.
These include certain "Hasura microservices" along with your own custom microservices.
Microservices are basically the individual 'apps' that run on a :doc:`Hasura cluster <../cluster/index>`.

:doc:`Hasura microservices <hasura-microservices>` include the backend APIs provided by Hasura and other components of the Hasura platform.

Some typical examples of custom microservices you would add to your project include an API service,
a microservice that serves static files, a simple HTML site or a single-page app (eg: React),
a ready made microservice like the ghost blog-engine or a 'stateful' microservice like a database.

Hasura microservices run in the **hasura namespace** while custom microservices run in the **default namespace** on a cluster.

.. note::

    If you are starting a new Hasura project, head to `hasura.io/hub <https://hasura.io/hub>`_ to
    find the right boilerplate project for you and follow the guide there!

Here's what your Hasura cluster looks like before and after you add custom microservices:
