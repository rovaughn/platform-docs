Passing ENV variables to a microservice
========================================

There might be certain variables that your microservices need but they might depend on the environment the microservices are running
in. For example, API keys for dev vs prod.

You can provide environment variables (or env variables) for a microservice to use
by editing the ``k8s.yaml`` file found at ``/microservices/<my-microservice>/k8s.yaml``
and adding a few lines. By combining this with :doc:`templating <../project/conf-files-templating>` capabilities,
you get a highly configurable environment.

.. note::

   The ``k8s.yaml`` file is generally a part of the code repository and hence should not
   store any sensitive variables in it. See :doc:`Project secrets <../project/secrets/index>` to handle sensitive variables.

Let's say you need to add four ENV variables as follows:

* ``CLUSTER_NAME`` should get the name of the cluster
* ``RELEASE_MODE`` should be ``production`` for the cluster with alias ``prod`` and ``dev`` for all other clusters
* ``X_ACCNT_ID`` is a fixed value, say ``GH456C``
* ``X_API_KEY`` is a secret value, say ``x.api.key``  (See :doc:`Project secrets <../project/secrets/index>`)

The ``k8s.yaml`` for such a configuration would look like the following:

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja
   :emphasize-lines: 21-36

      apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
      kind: Deployment
      metadata:
        creationTimestamp: null
        labels:
          app: app
          hasuraService: custom
        name: app
        namespace: '{{ cluster.metadata.namespaces.user }}'
      spec:
        replicas: 1
        strategy: {}
        template:
          metadata:
            creationTimestamp: null
            labels:
              app: app
          spec:
            containers:
            - image: hasura/hello-world:latest
              env:
              - name: CLUSTER_NAME
                value: '{{ cluster.name }}'
              - name: RELEASE_MODE
              {% if cluster.alias == "prod" %}
                value: production
              {% else %}
                value: dev
              {% endif %}
              - name: X_ACCNT_ID
                value: GH456C
              - name: X_API_KEY
                valueFrom:
                  secretKeyRef:
                    name: hasura-secrets
                    key: x.api.key
              imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
              name: app
              ports:
              - containerPort: 8080
                protocol: TCP
              resources: {}
            securityContext: {}
            terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0
      status: {}


To apply the changes, commit the ``k8s.yaml`` file and ``git push hasura master`` to deploy.

These variables will now be available and can be consumed from the application code within the microservice as ENV variables.
