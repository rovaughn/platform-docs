Setting up multiple environments using clusters
===============================================

Multiple Hasura clusters can be added to a single Hasura project. This is a common use case in development workflows
to simulate different environments.

For example, for a project one might have a ``dev`` cluster for use during development, a ``staging`` cluster, which
replicates the production environment and is used to test before making the
project live, and a ``production`` cluster for the live instance of the
project.

Creating new clusters
---------------------

Please see :doc:`this <create>` for instructions on creating new clusters.


Add a cluster to a project
--------------------------

To add a cluster to a project we use:

.. code-block:: bash

  # in project directory
  $ hasura cluster add <cluster-name> -c <cluster-alias>


.. note::

   The ``-c`` flag is to create an alias for the cluster. We can then use this alias in various other commands including git push.

Let's add the newly created two clusters to our projects.

.. code-block:: bash

  # in project directory
  $ hasura cluster add alarming52 -c staging

  ✓ SSH key (/home/wawhal/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) added to the cluster
  ✓ Cluster added to project

  $ hasura cluster add ambitious93 -c production

  ✓ SSH key (/home/wawhal/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) added to the cluster
  ✓ Cluster added to project

Now we have two clusters setup for the same project.


Deploy to a cluster
-------------------
Now whenever we make changes to our project, in the database schema, cluster
configuration or custom microservices, we just have to git-push to the correct
cluster to apply all our changes.

.. code-block:: bash

  # Make changes to the project directory and deploy to staging
  $ git push staging master

  # Finally ready to deploy to production
  $ git push production master
