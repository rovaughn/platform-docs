Creating a project
==================

You can create a Hasura project by cloning a project from the collection on `hasura hub <https://platform.hasura.io/hub>`_.

The following will 'clone' the project `hasura/base <https://platform.hasura.io/hub/project/hasura/base>`_ (an empty Hasura project) to your system.

.. code:: bash

   # creates a directory called '<my-project-dir>'
   # clones the Hasura project 'hasura/base' into it
   $ hasura clone hasura/base <my-project-dir>

      Cloning project...
      âœ“ Project cloned directory=<base-dir>/my-project-dir



You can clone any project from `hasura hub <https://platform.hasura.io/hub>`_ and use that as a starting point for your new project.

`hasura/hello-world <https://platform.hasura.io/hub/project/hasura/hello-world>`_ is a good starter project that contains a few database
migrations, some sample data and even a sample microservice to help learn about Hasura features quickly.

.. note::

  This command automatically initializes a git repository in your project folder
