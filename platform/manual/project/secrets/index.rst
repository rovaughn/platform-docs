Project secrets
===============

Project secrets are variables that your microservices need, but variables that are sensitive and not safe to expose in your git repository.
Here are some typical examples:

- Postgres (database) password
- API tokens for 3rd party APIs

Hasura gives you a simple way of managing your secrets directly on your cluster (via Kubernetes secrets) which
can then be passed as ENV variables to the microservices that need them.
