Project structure: conf/
========================

Configuration required to get a cluster ready for a project is stored as various files in this directory. When a configurations is applied on a cluster using either the ``git push`` or the ``conf apply`` command, these files are read to build a complete configuration object, also called ``hasura-conf``.

.. note::

   All files in this directory are rendered as a templates. Refer to :ref:`Conf files templating <conf-templating>` for more details.

You can apply configuration on a cluster either by doing ``git push`` or by using the :ref:`hasura conf apply <hasura_platform:conf_apply>` command.

To see what the differences in configuration across clusters are, or even between the configuration applied on a cluster and the one present locally, use :ref:`hasura conf diff <hasura_platform:conf_diff>`.

Following are the files present in this directory:
