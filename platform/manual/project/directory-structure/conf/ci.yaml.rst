===============================

.. note::

   This file is rendered as a template. Refer to :ref:`Conf files templating <conf-templating>` for more details.

Continuous integration settings for a cluster is specified in this file. Two parameters together define continuous integration: ``remotes`` and ``registry``.

remotes
-------

Details under a remote indicate which microservices have to be updated when a git push happens against that remote. Each key creates a git remote on the cluster. When a push is made to this cluster, docker images are built and the microservices are updated as per the definition.

.. code-block:: yaml

   remote-name:                                   # name of the remote
     namespace.microservice-name:                 # microservice to be updated
       container-name:                            # container name to be updated
         path: microservices/app                  # path where image has to be built
         dockerfile: microservices/app/Dockerfile # dockerfile for building the image

OR (only for Hasura CLI versions >= v0.2.50)

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: remote-name                  # name of the remote
   deployments:
   - name: deployment-name            # name of deployments to be updated
     namespace: deployment-namespace  # namespace of deployment
     containers:
     - name: container-name:          # name of container in deployment to be updated
       dockerBuild:                   # docker build context path and dockerfile
         contextPath: microservices/app
         dockerfilePath: microservices/app/Dockerfile


registry
--------

If a registry is defined, all docker images built will be pushed to and pulled from this registry. You can create a private registry and configure it to be used here. More details at [link].

.. code-block:: yaml

   prefix: gcr.io/example-registry
   regSecret: registry-secret-name
   

You can find the default file at `conf/ci.yaml <https://github.com/hasura/base/blob/master/conf/ci.yaml>`_ in the base repo.
