Project Directory Structure
===========================

The project (a.k.a. project directory) has a particular directory structure and
it has to be maintained strictly, else Hasura CLI would not work as expected. A
representative project is shown below:

.. toctree::
  :titlesonly:

   hasura.yaml <hasura.yaml>
   clusters.yaml <clusters.yaml>
   .hasura <.hasura>
   conf/ <conf/index>
   migrations/ <migrations/index>
   microservices/ <microservices/index>

.. note::

  hasura cli doesn't consider any other files or directories outside of those mentioned above
