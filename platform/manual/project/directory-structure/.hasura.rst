Project structure: .hasura
==========================

Info about the actual clusters added to this project can be found in this file. Each
cluster is defined by it's name allotted by Hasura, and an alias that matches with one in :ref:`clusters.yaml <hasura-project-directory-clusters-yaml>`.

.. note::

   ``.hasura`` is git-ignored by default so that you can easily share your Hasura Project with infrastructure configuration, but without any actual cluster details. But, if you want to version control this file also, you can do so by removing ``.hasura`` from ``.gitignore``.

The ``kubeContext`` mentions the name of the Kubernetes context used to access the
cluster and can be used with ``kubectl`` also.

The ``config`` key denotes the location
of the cluster's metadata on the cluster itself. This information is parsed and the
cluster's metadata is appended while the conf is rendered.

.. code-block:: yaml

   clusters:
   - alias: hasura
     config:
       configmap: controller-conf
       namespace: hasura
     data: null
     kubeContext: h33-blinders97
     name: h33-blinders97
   defaultCluster: hasura


Use :ref:`hasura cluster set-default <hasura_platform:cluster_set-default>` to set a ``defaultCluster``.

You can list all your clusters using :ref:`hasura cluster list <hasura_platform:cluster_list>` and add any of them to the project using :ref:`hasura cluster add <hasura_platform:cluster_add>`.

If you need to remove a cluster from a project, just remove the entry from ``.hasura``.
