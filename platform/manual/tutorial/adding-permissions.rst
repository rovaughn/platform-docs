Part IX: Permissions & access control on data models
====================================================

By default, the data APIs can only be accessed by users with the ``admin`` role. However, in
our blog app, users will not have the admin role assigned. So, we need to allow access to the data APIs for
roles other than ``admin``. This is handled by the permission layer of the ``data`` microservice,
which lets you define row level and column level access control policies for all the roles and for different query types.

In our blog app, what roles do we have other than ``admin``?

#. ``user`` for logged in users
#. ``anonymous`` for users who haven't logged in.

We need to define permissions on all the tables that we have created so far for the ``user`` and ``anonymous`` roles.

Let's look at the access conditions we should set up for our tables:

.. rst-class:: api_tabs
.. tabs::

   .. tab:: article

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 20 20 25 35

         * - Role
           - Query type
           - Columns
           - Rows
         * - anonymous
           - select
           - all columns
           - all rows
         * - anonymous
           - insert
           - --
           - not allowed
         * - anonymous
           - update
           - none
           - not allowed
         * - anonymous

           - delete
           - --
           - if user is the author

   .. tab:: author

To summarize:

* ``anonymous`` role users can select (read) all the data.
* ``anonymous`` role users cannot modify (insert/delete/update) any data.
* ``user`` role users can select (read) all the data.
* ``user`` role users can insert/delete "their own data" and update only certain fields once inserted.

To define "their own data", we can describe a condition using the value of the ``X-Hasura-User-Id`` header passed to
the data microservice by the API gateway (as explained in the :doc:`user, roles & sessions <user-model>` section).

The following are the conditions we will use while setting up the row level permissions described above:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 20 25 40

   * - Table
     - Definition
     - Condition
     - Representation
   * - All tables
     - allow all rows
     - Without any checks
     -
       .. code-block:: json

          {}

   * - article
     - user is author
     - user-id is equal to ``author_id``
     -
       .. code-block:: json

          {
            "author_id": {
              "$eq": "X-Hasura-User-Id"
            }
          }

   * - author
     - user's own row
     - user-id is equal to ``id``
     -
       .. code-block:: json

          {
            "id": {
              "$eq": "X-Hasura-User-Id"
            }
          }

   * - like
     - user gave like
     - user-id is equal to ``user_id``
     -
       .. code-block:: json

          {
            "user_id": {
              "$eq": "X-Hasura-User-Id"
            }
          }

   * - comment
     - user wrote comment
     - user-id is equal to ``user_id``
     -
       .. code-block:: json

          {
            "user_id": {
              "$eq": "X-Hasura-User-Id"
            }
          }

   * - comment
     - user wrote comment or is author of article
     - user-id is equal to ``user_id`` or user-id is equal to ``article's author_id`` (this requires a relationship
       called ``article`` to be defined first)
     -
       .. code-block:: json

          {
            "$or": [
              {
                "user_id": {
                  "$eq": "X-Hasura-User-Id"
                }
              },
              {
                "article": {
                  "author_id": {
                    "$eq": "X-Hasura-User-Id"
                  }
                }
              }
            ]
          }

Defining permissions:
---------------------
We can use the ``API console`` UI to add permissions for our tables. Head to *Data -> [table-name] -> Permissions* to
see/modify the permissions on the table.

**For example**, let's set the ``update`` permissions for the ``user`` role on the ``article`` table:

The *Permissions* tab of the ``article`` table should look like this:

.. image:: ../../../img/platform/manual/tutorial/tutorial-permissions-tab.png

Click on the *Edit* icon next to the user/update cell. It should open up an edit section like this:

.. image:: ../../../img/platform/manual/tutorial/tutorial-permissions-edit-empty.png

Now, set the permissions as described above. It should eventually look like this:

.. image:: ../../../img/platform/manual/tutorial/tutorial-permissions-edit-filled.png

Hit *Save permissions* to save our changes.

Similary, set permissions for all the cases we have described above.
