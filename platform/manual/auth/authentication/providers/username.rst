   Authorization: Bearer <auth_token>

.. note::
    The logout request is a POST request with an empty body.


Change password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the user is logged in, they can change their password using the following
endpoint.

.. code-block:: http

   POST auth.<cluster-name>.hasura-app.io/v1/user/change-password HTTP/1.1
   Authorization: Bearer <auth_token>

   {
     "old_password": "oldpassword",
     "new_password": "newpassword"
   }


Forgot password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Username provider does not have a forgot password feature. This is by
design, as it does not have any channel (like email) to send a forgot password
token to the user.

If you want this feature, use either the email or mobile/password provider.
