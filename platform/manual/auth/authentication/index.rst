Authentication methods a.k.a. providers
=======================================

Hasura auth has support for multiple ways to authenticate (i.e. login/register) a user. e.g. username-based, email-based, mobile-based, social logins, etc.

Hasura auth calls each authentication method a **"provider"**.

You can :doc:`enable/disable providers <configure-auth-methods>` in your auth configuration. Once a provider is
enabled you can use them to signup your users. **You can have multiple
providers enabled at the same time.**

Also, if you have an **existing custom authentication system** you can create a
:doc:`custom provider <providers/custom-provider>` and configure it with Hasura auth.

The following providers come by default with Hasura auth:
